# Recipe Fetcher

Automatically scrape and fetch recipes from web page

## Metadata needed

For every website, we need the following:

- Title: Name of the recipe
- Webpage: The hyperlink of the corresponding recipe

## Inspiration

- Lot of different types of food to cook because I get bored of eating same types of food.
- Improve my quality of cooking and creativity as well.
- Lack of time in going through so many pages.
- Find ways to automate the process

## Ambition

- Create one script that can scrap the webpage without having to manually check the document structure.
